# Group_3_Project_2

Two files need to be run to see our full project. The python app.py file that connects to our data on SQLite should be run separately and will show you a webpage with a table of the compiled state data we used.  Unfortunately, we were unable to get the app.py to support all of our html pages in time to meet the submission deadline.  We will definitely make sure the app.py is fully functioning for our Project 3.

Our visualizations can be seen by launching the index.html file and using the NAV bar to navigate to the different pages (health factors, map, and income).

Please let us know if you have any questions.
